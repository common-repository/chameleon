Chameleon is a revolutionary convenience among WordPress plugin world, it's an idea to provide easy styling for all kind of layout templates. It helps you to choose a unique theme for your favorite plugin, form, templates and themes. Initially a few famous plugins are added in compatibility list but later more plugins will be added. To bring freshness in styles and features, we are using GitHub so public can participate in styles too. People can push their own styles and/or corrections in existing list. We are excited to offer this idea especially for WordPress default twenty series theme. WordPress audience will must like this ready to go thing.
